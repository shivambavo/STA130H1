    "### Chatbot Summary: Data Cleaning and Error Handling with the Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "To clean the Titanic dataset by handling missing values effectively and then intentionally introduce and fix common coding errors to improve data analysis and debugging skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Data**:\n",
    "   - Reviewed the Titanic dataset's structure, identifying that the `Cabin` and `Age` columns had a significant number of missing values, while most other columns had very few or none.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decided on the Data Cleaning Approach**:\n",
    "   - **Remove the `Cabin` column**: Due to a high number of missing values (687 out of 891) and its low relevance to most analyses.\n",
    "   - **Impute missing values in the `Age` column**: Fill missing `Age` values with the median to maintain data integrity without introducing bias.\n",
    "   - **Drop remaining rows with missing values**: After handling `Cabin` and `Age`, drop any rows with missing values in other columns to ensure a clean dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implemented the Data Cleaning Steps**:\n",
    "   - Removed the `Cabin` column using `del df['Cabin']`.\n",
    "   - Imputed missing `Age` values using the median with `df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)`.\n",
    "   - Dropped any remaining rows with missing values using `df.dropna(inplace=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Created a Simplified Before and After Report**:\n",
    "   - Introduced a concise reporting function to provide a clear summary of the dataset's state before and after cleaning, including the number of rows, columns, and missing values per column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "- The dataset was successfully cleaned, with all missing values addressed. The `Cabin` column was removed, `Age` values were imputed, and remaining rows with missing values were dropped, resulting in a dataset ready for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Proceed with more advanced data analysis, such as feature engineering, data visualization, or building predictive models using the cleaned Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Debugging Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the dataset, we explored various intentional errors and their fixes to enhance our understanding of common coding issues and debugging techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forget to Import a Library**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Removed the `import pandas as pd` line, which caused a `NameError: name 'pd' is not defined`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Re-added the `import pandas as pd` line to fix the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incorrect Filename in URL**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Changed the filename in the URL from `titanic.csv` to `titanics.csv`, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Corrected the filename in the URL back to `titanic.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Typo in URL Domain or Path**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Introduced typos in different parts of the URL (e.g., domain name, path), resulting in various errors like `URLError` and `HTTPError 404: Not Found`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Corrected the typos in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using a Variable Before Assignment**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Misnamed the DataFrame variable, e.g., `Titanic_Data` instead of `titanic_data`, causing a `NameError`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Corrected the variable name to `titanic_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Missing Parenthesis in Function Call**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Removed a closing parenthesis in a function call like `pd.read_csv(url`, resulting in a `SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Added the missing parenthesis to complete the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mistyped Function Names**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Misspelled function names like `group_by` instead of `groupby` and `describle` instead of `describe`, causing `AttributeError`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Corrected the function names to `groupby` and `describe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Using a Column Name Not in the Data**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Used incorrect column names in `groupby` and column selection, e.g., `\"Sex\"` instead of `\"sex\"` and `\"age\"` instead of `\"Age\"`, resulting in `KeyError`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Corrected the column names to match exactly those in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Forgetting to Put Column Names in Quotes**:\n",
    "   - **Error Created**: Omitted quotes around column names, such as `groupby(sex)` instead of `groupby(\"sex\")`, causing a `NameError`.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Added quotes around column names to ensure they are treated as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "This exercise demonstrated how to clean a dataset effectively and handle missing values while providing practical experience in identifying, creating, and fixing common programming errors. The process strengthened understanding of debugging techniques and helped develop best practices for data analysis using pandas.\n"
